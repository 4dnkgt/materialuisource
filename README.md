Hello, welcome to the Material UI Source code

# Setting UP
First of all you must download it, and then open up "MaterialUI.exe" you'll be greeted with a prompt asking you to input your synapse X path such as
"C:\Users\raylen\Desktop\raylen\Synapse-X" *without the quotation marks* after that it might take a few seconds for the UI to show up If it doesnt show up, restart the program from the command prompt by doing taskkill /IM synapsetest.exe
# Changing the path of Synapse X
to change the path you can simply go to the options menu and change it from there
